# Instructions for updating the text 
- The files with the texts are located here: [/locales/en.yml](/locales/en.yml) for english and [/locales/pt.yml](/locales/pt.yml) for portuguese. 
- In order to check the result, you have to build and run the project, or access the url: http://gatoto.herokuapp.com to match the text
- If you choosen to build the project make sure you have Ruby 2.4 installed, you can use https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv to accomplish that and install bundler http://bundler.io/
- After both are installed just run the command `bundle` and after `blundle exec puma`, the server will run at http://localhost:9292
