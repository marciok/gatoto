        Bitcoin for Education
      second_title:
        “Education is the most powerful weapon, which
        you can use to change the world." - Nelson Mandela
      description_1:
        Low-income families find it increasingly difficult to support their
        children’s education, making it necessary for children to exit the
        educational system in order to help their families with surplus resources.

      description_2:
        The challenge we face is to invert this flow by providing the basic resources
        and thus, providing sufficient incentive for the families to plan a better
        future for their children.

        Kenya - Gatoto School
      second_title:
        Assists more than 1,000 students between 5 and 15 years old.
      description:
        The community formed Gatoto in 1994 because they understood that their
        children would not receive education without their action.<br><br>

        Today, the school is ranked in the top 10 of community schools in Nairobi and
        competes alongside well-funded private and public schools in many areas, from
        standardized test scores to sports competitions. With 25 teachers and 14 support staff, the school has a very dedicated and
        qualified team.

      description:
        Founded in 1987, the organization aimed to support and provide education for
        thousands of children that had to wait until 7 years old to be accepted in
        a public school in the community of Paraisópolis (São Paulo).<br><br>

        There are activities related to music, literature, dance, games and play, all designed in
        a way that supports the learning process and amplifies the curriculum together with the
        active participation of families and the community.

      second_title:
        As a consequence to the international economic crisis, funding has decreased significantly
        and the schools are experiencing several challenges. The most vital one is to keep the basic
        needs like Education and food for its students.<br><br>
